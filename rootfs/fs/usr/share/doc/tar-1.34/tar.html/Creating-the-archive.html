<span id="Creating-the-Archive"></span><h4 class="subsection">2.6.2 Creating the Archive</h4>

<span id="index-create_002c-introduced"></span>
<p>To place the files <samp>blues</samp>, <samp>folk</samp>, and <samp>jazz</samp> into an
archive named <samp>collection.tar</samp>, use the following command:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar --create --file=collection.tar blues folk jazz</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>The order of the arguments is not very important, <em>when using long
option forms</em>, however you should always remember to use option as the
first argument to tar.   For example, the following is wrong:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar blues -c folk -f collection.tar jazz</kbd>
tar: -c: Invalid blocking factor
Try 'tar --help' or 'tar --usage' for more information.
</pre></div>

<p>The error message is produced because <code>tar</code> always treats its
first argument as an option (or cluster of options), even if it does
not start with dash.  This is <em>traditional</em> or <em>old option</em>
style, called so because all implementations of <code>tar</code> have
used it since the very inception of the tar archiver in 1970s.  This
option style will be explained later (see <a href="Old-Options.html">Old Option Style</a>), for now
just remember to always place option as the first argument.
</p>
<p>That being said, you could issue the following command:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar --create folk blues --file=collection.tar jazz</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>However, you can see that this order is harder to understand; this is
why we will list the arguments in the order that makes the commands
easiest to understand (and we encourage you to do the same when you use
<code>tar</code>, to avoid errors).
</p>
<p>Note that the sequence
<samp>--file=collection.tar</samp> is considered to be <em>one</em> argument.
If you substituted any other string of characters for
<kbd>collection.tar</kbd>,  then that string would become the name of the
archive file you create.
</p>
<p>The order of the options becomes more important when you begin to use
short forms.  With short forms, if you type commands in the wrong order
(even if you type them correctly in all other ways), you may end up with
results you don&rsquo;t expect.  For this reason, it is a good idea to get
into the habit of typing options in the order that makes inherent sense.
See <a href="short-create.html">Short Forms with &lsquo;<samp>create</samp>&rsquo;</a>, for more information on this.
</p>
<p>In this example, you type the command as shown above: <samp>--create</samp>
is the operation which creates the new archive
(<samp>collection.tar</samp>), and <samp>--file</samp> is the option which lets
you give it the name you chose.  The files, <samp>blues</samp>, <samp>folk</samp>,
and <samp>jazz</samp>, are now members of the archive, <samp>collection.tar</samp>
(they are <em>file name arguments</em> to the <samp>--create</samp> operation.
See <a href="Choosing.html">Choosing Files and Names for <code>tar</code></a>, for the detailed discussion on these.) Now that they are
in the archive, they are called <em>archive members</em>, not files.
(see <a href="Definitions.html">members</a>).
</p>
<p>When you create an archive, you <em>must</em> specify which files you
want placed in the archive.  If you do not specify any archive
members, <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> will complain.
</p>
<p>If you now list the contents of the working directory (<code>ls</code>), you will
find the archive file listed as well as the files you saw previously:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">blues   folk   jazz   collection.tar
</pre></div>

<p>Creating the archive &lsquo;<samp>collection.tar</samp>&rsquo; did not destroy the copies of
the files in the directory.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you don&rsquo;t indicate an operation, <code>tar</code> will not
run and will prompt you for one.  If you don&rsquo;t name any files, <code>tar</code>
will complain.  You must have write access to the working directory,
or else you will not be able to create an archive in that directory.
</p>
<p><em>Caution</em>: Do not attempt to use <samp>--create</samp> (<samp>-c</samp>) to add files to
an existing archive; it will delete the archive and write a new one.
Use <samp>--append</samp> (<samp>-r</samp>) instead.  See <a href="append.html">How to Add Files to Existing Archives: <samp>--append</samp></a>.
