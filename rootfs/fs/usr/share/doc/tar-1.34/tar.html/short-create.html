<span id="Short-Forms-with-create"></span><h4 class="subsection">2.6.4 Short Forms with &lsquo;<samp>create</samp>&rsquo;</h4>

<p>As we said before, the <samp>--create</samp> (<samp>-c</samp>) operation is one of the most
basic uses of <code>tar</code>, and you will use it countless times.
Eventually, you will probably want to use abbreviated (or &ldquo;short&rdquo;)
forms of options.  A full discussion of the three different forms that
options can take appears in <a href="Styles.html">The Three Option Styles</a>; for now, here is what the
previous example (including the <samp>--verbose</samp> (<samp>-v</samp>) option) looks like
using short option forms:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar -cvf collection.tar blues folk jazz</kbd>
blues
folk
jazz
</pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the system responds the same no matter whether you use
long or short option forms.
</p>
<p>One difference between using
short and long option forms is that, although the exact placement of
arguments following options is no more specific when using short forms,
it is easier to become confused and make a mistake when using short
forms.  For example, suppose you attempted the above example in the
following way:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar -cfv collection.tar blues folk jazz</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, <code>tar</code> will make an archive file called <samp>v</samp>,
containing the files <samp>blues</samp>, <samp>folk</samp>, and <samp>jazz</samp>, because
the &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; is the closest &ldquo;file name&rdquo; to the <samp>-f</samp> option, and
is thus taken to be the chosen archive file name.  <code>tar</code> will try
to add a file called <samp>collection.tar</samp> to the <samp>v</samp> archive file;
if the file <samp>collection.tar</samp> did not already exist, <code>tar</code> will
report an error indicating that this file does not exist.  If the file
<samp>collection.tar</samp> does already exist (e.g., from a previous command
you may have run), then <code>tar</code> will add this file to the archive.
Because the <samp>-v</samp> option did not get registered, <code>tar</code> will not
run under &lsquo;<samp>verbose</samp>&rsquo; mode, and will not report its progress.
</p>
<p>The end result is that you may be quite confused about what happened,
and possibly overwrite a file.  To illustrate this further, we will show
you how an example we showed previously would look using short forms.
</p>
<p>This example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar --create folk blues --file=collection.tar jazz</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>is confusing as it is.  It becomes even more so when using short forms:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar -c folk blues -f collection.tar jazz</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>It would be very easy to put the wrong string of characters
immediately following the <samp>-f</samp>, but doing that could sacrifice
valuable data.
</p>
<p>For this reason, we recommend that you pay very careful attention to
the order of options and placement of file and archive names,
especially when using short option forms.  Not having the option name
written out mnemonically can affect how well you remember which option
does what, and therefore where different names have to be placed.
