<span id="Using-tar-to-Perform-Incremental-Dumps"></span><h3 class="section">5.2 Using <code>tar</code> to Perform Incremental Dumps</h3>

<p><em>Incremental backup</em> is a special form of <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> archive that
stores additional metadata so that exact state of the file system
can be restored when extracting the archive.
</p>
<p><acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> currently offers two options for handling incremental
backups: <samp>--listed-incremental=<var>snapshot-file</var></samp> (<samp>-g
<var>snapshot-file</var></samp>) and <samp>--incremental</samp> (<samp>-G</samp>).
</p>
<span id="index-listed_002dincremental_002c-described"></span>
<p>The option <samp>--listed-incremental</samp> instructs tar to operate on
an incremental archive with additional metadata stored in a standalone
file, called a <em>snapshot file</em>.  The purpose of this file is to help
determine which files have been changed, added or deleted since the
last backup, so that the next incremental backup will contain only
modified files.  The name of the snapshot file is given as an argument
to the option:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><samp>--listed-incremental=<var>file</var></samp></span></dt>
<dt><span><samp>-g <var>file</var></samp></span></dt>
<dd><p>Handle incremental backups with snapshot data in <var>file</var>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>To create an incremental backup, you would use
<samp>--listed-incremental</samp> together with <samp>--create</samp>
(see <a href="create.html">How to Create Archives</a>).  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar --create \
           --file=archive.1.tar \
           --listed-incremental=/var/log/usr.snar \
           /usr</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>This will create in <samp>archive.1.tar</samp> an incremental backup of
the <samp>/usr</samp> file system, storing additional metadata in the file
<samp>/var/log/usr.snar</samp>.  If this file does not exist, it will be
created.  The created archive will then be a <em>level 0 backup</em>;
please see the next section for more on backup levels.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the file <samp>/var/log/usr.snar</samp> exists, it
determines which files are modified.  In this case only these files will be
stored in the archive.  Suppose, for example, that after running the
above command, you delete file <samp>/usr/doc/old</samp> and create
directory <samp>/usr/local/db</samp> with the following contents:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>ls /usr/local/db</kbd>
/usr/local/db/data
/usr/local/db/index
</pre></div>

<p>Some time later you create another incremental backup.  You will
then see:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar --create \
           --file=archive.2.tar \
           --listed-incremental=/var/log/usr.snar \
           /usr</kbd>
tar: usr/local/db: Directory is new
usr/local/db/
usr/local/db/data
usr/local/db/index
</pre></div>

<p>The created archive <samp>archive.2.tar</samp> will contain only these
three members.  This archive is called a <em>level 1 backup</em>.  Notice
that <samp>/var/log/usr.snar</samp> will be updated with the new data, so if
you plan to create more &lsquo;<samp>level 1</samp>&rsquo; backups, it is necessary to
create a working copy of the snapshot file before running
<code>tar</code>.  The above example will then be modified as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>cp /var/log/usr.snar /var/log/usr.snar-1</kbd>
$ <kbd>tar --create \
           --file=archive.2.tar \
           --listed-incremental=/var/log/usr.snar-1 \
           /usr</kbd>
</pre></div>

<span id="g_t_002d_002dlevel_003d0"></span><span id="index-level_002c-described"></span>
<p>You can force &lsquo;<samp>level 0</samp>&rsquo; backups either by removing the snapshot
file before running <code>tar</code>, or by supplying the
<samp>--level=0</samp> option, e.g.:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar --create \
           --file=archive.2.tar \
           --listed-incremental=/var/log/usr.snar-0 \
           --level=0 \
           /usr</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>Incremental dumps depend crucially on time stamps, so the results are
unreliable if you modify a file&rsquo;s time stamps during dumping (e.g.,
with the <samp>--atime-preserve=replace</samp> option), or if you set the clock
backwards.
</p>
<span id="device-numbers"></span><span id="index-Device-numbers_002c-using-in-incremental-backups"></span>
<p>Metadata stored in snapshot files include device numbers, which,
obviously are supposed to be non-volatile values.  However, it turns
out that <acronym>NFS</acronym> devices have undependable values when an automounter
gets in the picture.  This can lead to a great deal of spurious
redumping in incremental dumps, so it is somewhat useless to compare
two <acronym>NFS</acronym> devices numbers over time.  The solution implemented
currently is to consider all <acronym>NFS</acronym> devices as being equal
when it comes to comparing directories; this is fairly gross, but
there does not seem to be a better way to go.
</p>
<p>Apart from using <acronym>NFS</acronym>, there are a number of cases where
relying on device numbers can cause spurious redumping of unmodified
files.  For example, this occurs when archiving <acronym>LVM</acronym> snapshot
volumes.  To avoid this, use <samp>--no-check-device</samp> option:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><span id="index-no_002dcheck_002ddevice_002c-described"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span><samp>--no-check-device</samp></span></dt>
<dd><p>Do not rely on device numbers when preparing a list of changed files
for an incremental dump.
</p>
<span id="index-check_002ddevice_002c-described"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span><samp>--check-device</samp></span></dt>
<dd><p>Use device numbers when preparing a list of changed files
for an incremental dump.  This is the default behavior.  The purpose
of this option is to undo the effect of the <samp>--no-check-device</samp>
if it was given in <code>TAR_OPTIONS</code> environment variable
(see <a href="using-tar-options.html#TAR_005fOPTIONS">TAR_OPTIONS</a>).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>There is also another way to cope with changing device numbers.  It is
described in detail in <a href="Fixing-Snapshot-Files.html">Fixing Snapshot Files</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that incremental archives use <code>tar</code> extensions and may
not be readable by non-<acronym>GNU</acronym> versions of the <code>tar</code> program.
</p>
<span id="index-listed_002dincremental_002c-using-with-_002d_002dextract"></span>
<span id="index-extract_002c-using-with-_002d_002dlisted_002dincremental"></span>
<p>To extract from the incremental dumps, use
<samp>--listed-incremental</samp> together with <samp>--extract</samp>
option (see <a href="extracting-files.html">Extracting Specific Files</a>).  In this case, <code>tar</code> does
not need to access snapshot file, since all the data necessary for
extraction are stored in the archive itself.  So, when extracting, you
can give whatever argument to <samp>--listed-incremental</samp>, the usual
practice is to use <samp>--listed-incremental=/dev/null</samp>.
Alternatively, you can use <samp>--incremental</samp>, which needs no
arguments.  In general, <samp>--incremental</samp> (<samp>-G</samp>) can be
used as a shortcut for <samp>--listed-incremental</samp> when listing or
extracting incremental backups (for more information regarding this
option, see <a href="#incremental_002dop">incremental-op</a>).
</p>
<p>When extracting from the incremental backup <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> attempts to
restore the exact state the file system had when the archive was
created.  In particular, it will <em>delete</em> those files in the file
system that did not exist in their directories when the archive was
created.  If you have created several levels of incremental files,
then in order to restore the exact contents the file system  had when
the last level was created, you will need to restore from all backups
in turn.  Continuing our example, to restore the state of <samp>/usr</samp>
file system, one would do<a id="DOCF12" href="#FOOT12"><sup>12</sup></a>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar --extract \
           --listed-incremental=/dev/null \
           --file archive.1.tar</kbd>
$ <kbd>tar --extract \
           --listed-incremental=/dev/null \
           --file archive.2.tar</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>To list the contents of an incremental archive, use <samp>--list</samp>
(see <a href="list.html">How to List Archives</a>), as usual.  To obtain more information about the
archive, use <samp>--listed-incremental</samp> or <samp>--incremental</samp>
combined with two <samp>--verbose</samp> options<a id="DOCF13" href="#FOOT13"><sup>13</sup></a>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><kbd>tar --list --incremental --verbose --verbose --file archive.tar</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>This command will print, for each directory in the archive, the list
of files in that directory at the time the archive was created.  This
information is put out in a format which is both human-readable and
unambiguous for a program: each file name is printed as
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><var>x</var> <var>file</var>
</pre></div>

<p>where <var>x</var> is a letter describing the status of the file: &lsquo;<samp>Y</samp>&rsquo;
if the file  is present in the archive, &lsquo;<samp>N</samp>&rsquo; if the file is not
included in the archive, or a &lsquo;<samp>D</samp>&rsquo; if the file is a directory (and
is included in the archive).  See <a href="Dumpdir.html">Dumpdir</a>, for the detailed
description of dumpdirs and status codes.  Each such
line is terminated by a newline character.  The last line is followed
by an additional newline to indicate the end of the data.
</p>
<span id="incremental_002dop"></span><p>The option <samp>--incremental</samp> (<samp>-G</samp>)
gives the same behavior as <samp>--listed-incremental</samp> when used
with <samp>--list</samp> and <samp>--extract</samp> options.  When used with
<samp>--create</samp> option, it creates an incremental archive without
creating snapshot file.  Thus, it is impossible to create several
levels of incremental backups with <samp>--incremental</samp> option.

<h5><a id="FOOT12" href="#DOCF12">(12)</a></h5>
<p>Notice, that since both archives
were created without <samp>-P</samp> option (see <a href="absolute.html">Absolute File Names</a>), these
commands should be run from the root file system.</p>
<h5><a id="FOOT13" href="#DOCF13">(13)</a></h5>
<p>Two
<samp>--verbose</samp> options were selected to avoid breaking usual
verbose listing output (<samp>--list --verbose</samp>) when using in
scripts.

<p>Versions of <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> up to 1.15.1 used to dump verbatim binary
contents of the DUMPDIR header (with terminating nulls) when
<samp>--incremental</samp> or <samp>--listed-incremental</samp> option was
given, no matter what the verbosity level.  This behavior, and,
especially, the binary output it produced were considered inconvenient
and were changed in version 1.16.</p>
