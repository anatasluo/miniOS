<span id="Extracting-Files-that-are-Directories"></span><h4 class="subsection">2.8.3 Extracting Files that are Directories</h4>

<p>Extracting directories which are members of an archive is similar to
extracting other files.  The main difference to be aware of is that if
the extracted directory has the same name as any directory already in
the working directory, then files in the extracted directory will be
placed into the directory of the same name.  Likewise, if there are
files in the pre-existing directory with the same names as the members
which you extract, the files from the extracted archive will replace
the files already in the working directory (and possible
subdirectories).  This will happen regardless of whether or not the
files in the working directory were more recent than those extracted
(there exist, however, special options that alter this behavior
see <a href="Writing.html">Changing How <code>tar</code> Writes Files</a>).
</p>
<p>However, if a file was stored with a directory name as part of its file
name, and that directory does not exist under the working directory when
the file is extracted, <code>tar</code> will create the directory.
</p>
<p>We can demonstrate how to use <samp>--extract</samp> to extract a directory
file with an example.  Change to the <samp>practice</samp> directory if you
weren&rsquo;t there, and remove the files <samp>folk</samp> and <samp>jazz</samp>.  Then,
go back to the parent directory and extract the archive
<samp>music.tar</samp>.  You may either extract the entire archive, or you may
extract only the files you just deleted.  To extract the entire archive,
don&rsquo;t give any file names as arguments after the archive name
<samp>music.tar</samp>.  To extract only the files you deleted, use the
following command:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar -xvf music.tar practice/folk practice/jazz</kbd>
practice/folk
practice/jazz
</pre></div>

<p>If you were to specify two <samp>--verbose</samp> (<samp>-v</samp>) options, <code>tar</code>
would have displayed more detail about the extracted files, as shown
in the example below:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>tar -xvvf music.tar practice/folk practice/jazz</kbd>
-rw-r--r-- me/user          28 1996-10-18 16:31 practice/jazz
-rw-r--r-- me/user          20 1996-09-23 16:44 practice/folk
</pre></div>

<p>Because you created the directory with <samp>practice</samp> as part of the
file names of each of the files by archiving the <samp>practice</samp>
directory as <samp>practice</samp>, you must give <samp>practice</samp> as part
of the file names when you extract those files from the archive.
