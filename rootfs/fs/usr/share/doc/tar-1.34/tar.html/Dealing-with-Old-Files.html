<span id="index-overwrite_002ddir_002c-introduced"></span>
<p>When extracting files, if <code>tar</code> discovers that the extracted
file already exists, it normally replaces the file by removing it before
extracting it, to prevent confusion in the presence of hard or symbolic
links.  (If the existing file is a symbolic link, it is removed, not
followed.)  However, if a directory cannot be removed because it is
nonempty, <code>tar</code> normally overwrites its metadata (ownership,
permission, etc.).  The <samp>--overwrite-dir</samp> option enables this
default behavior.  To be more cautious and preserve the metadata of
such a directory, use the <samp>--no-overwrite-dir</samp> option.
</p>
<span id="index-Overwriting-old-files_002c-prevention"></span>
<span id="index-keep_002dold_002dfiles_002c-introduced"></span>
<p>To be even more cautious and prevent existing files from being replaced, use
the <samp>--keep-old-files</samp> (<samp>-k</samp>) option.  It causes
<code>tar</code> to refuse to replace or update a file that already
exists, i.e., a file with the same name as an archive member prevents
extraction of that archive member.  Instead, it reports an error.  For
example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ <kbd>ls</kbd>
blues
$ <kbd>tar -x -k -f archive.tar</kbd>
tar: blues: Cannot open: File exists
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
</pre></div>

<span id="index-skip_002dold_002dfiles_002c-introduced"></span>
<p>If you wish to preserve old files untouched, but don&rsquo;t want
<code>tar</code> to treat them as errors, use the
<samp>--skip-old-files</samp> option.  This option causes <code>tar</code> to
silently skip extracting over existing files.
</p>
<span id="index-overwrite_002c-introduced"></span>
<p>To be more aggressive about altering existing files, use the
<samp>--overwrite</samp> option.  It causes <code>tar</code> to overwrite
existing files and to follow existing symbolic links when extracting.
</p>
<span id="index-Protecting-old-files"></span>
<p>Some people argue that <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> should not hesitate
to overwrite files with other files when extracting.  When extracting
a <code>tar</code> archive, they expect to see a faithful copy of the
state of the file system when the archive was created.  It is debatable
that this would always be a proper behavior.  For example, suppose one
has an archive in which <samp>usr/local</samp> is a link to
<samp>usr/local2</samp>.  Since then, maybe the site removed the link and
renamed the whole hierarchy from <samp>/usr/local2</samp> to
<samp>/usr/local</samp>.  Such things happen all the time.  I guess it would
not be welcome at all that <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> removes the
whole hierarchy just to make room for the link to be reinstated
(unless it <em>also</em> simultaneously restores the full
<samp>/usr/local2</samp>, of course!)  <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> is indeed
able to remove a whole hierarchy to reestablish a symbolic link, for
example, but <em>only if</em> <samp>--recursive-unlink</samp> is specified
to allow this behavior.  In any case, single files are silently
removed.
</p>
<span id="index-unlink_002dfirst_002c-introduced"></span>
<p>Finally, the <samp>--unlink-first</samp> (<samp>-U</samp>) option can improve performance in
some cases by causing <code>tar</code> to remove files unconditionally
before extracting them.
