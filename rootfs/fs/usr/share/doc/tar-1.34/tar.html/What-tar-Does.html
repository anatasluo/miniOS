<span id="What-tar-Does-1"></span><h3 class="section">1.3 What <code>tar</code> Does</h3>

<span id="index-tar"></span>
<p>The <code>tar</code> program provides the ability to create <code>tar</code>
archives, as well as various other kinds of manipulation.  For example,
you can use <code>tar</code> on previously created archives to extract files,
to store additional files, or to update or list files which were already
stored.
</p>
<p>Initially, <code>tar</code> archives were used to store files conveniently on
magnetic tape.  The name <code>tar</code> comes from this use; it stands for
<code>t</code>ape <code>ar</code>chiver.  Despite the utility&rsquo;s name, <code>tar</code> can
direct its output to available devices, files, or other programs (using
pipes).  <code>tar</code> may even access remote devices or files (as archives).
</p>
<p>You can use <code>tar</code> archives in many ways.  We want to stress a few
of them: storage, backup, and transportation.
</p>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>Storage</span></dt>
<dd><p>Often, <code>tar</code> archives are used to store related files for
convenient file transfer over a network.  For example, the
<acronym>GNU</acronym> Project distributes its software bundled into
<code>tar</code> archives, so that all the files relating to a particular
program (or set of related programs) can be transferred as a single
unit.
</p>
<p>A magnetic tape can store several files in sequence.  However, the tape
has no names for these files; it only knows their relative position on
the tape.  One way to store several files on one tape and retain their
names is by creating a <code>tar</code> archive.  Even when the basic transfer
mechanism can keep track of names, as FTP can, the nuisance of handling
multiple files, directories, and multiple links makes <code>tar</code>
archives useful.
</p>
<p>Archive files are also used for long-term storage.  You can think of
this as transportation from the present into the future.  (It is a
science-fiction idiom that you can move through time as well as in
space; the idea here is that <code>tar</code> can be used to move archives in
all dimensions, even time!)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Backup</span></dt>
<dd><p>Because the archive created by <code>tar</code> is capable of preserving
file information and directory structure, <code>tar</code> is commonly
used for performing full and incremental backups of disks.  A backup
puts a collection of files (possibly pertaining to many users and
projects) together on a disk or a tape.  This guards against
accidental destruction of the information in those files.
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>tar</code> has special features that allow it to be
used to make incremental and full dumps of all the files in a
file system.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Transportation</span></dt>
<dd><p>You can create an archive on one system, transfer it to another system,
and extract the contents there.  This allows you to transport a group of
files from one system to another.
</p></dd>
