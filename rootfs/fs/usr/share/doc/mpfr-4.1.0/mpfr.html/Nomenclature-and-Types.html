<span id="index-Floating_002dpoint-number"></span>
<span id="index-Regular-number"></span>
<span id="index-mpfr_005ft"></span>
<span id="index-mpfr_005fptr"></span>
<p>A <em>floating-point number</em>, or <em>float</em> for short, is an object
representing a radix-2 floating-point number consisting of a sign,
an arbitrary-precision normalized significand (also called mantissa),
and an exponent (an integer in some given range); these are called
<em>regular numbers</em>. Like in the IEEE&nbsp;754 standard, a floating-point
number can also have three kinds of special values: a signed zero, a
signed infinity, and Not-a-Number (NaN). NaN can represent the default
value of a floating-point object and the result of some operations for
which no other results would make sense, such as 0 divided by 0 or
+Infinity minus +Infinity; unless documented otherwise, the sign bit of
a NaN is unspecified. Note that contrary to IEEE&nbsp;754, MPFR has a single
kind of NaN and does not have subnormals. Other than that, the behavior
is very similar to IEEE&nbsp;754, but there may be some differences.
</p>
<p>The C data type for such objects is <code>mpfr_t</code>, internally defined
as a one-element array of a structure (so that when passed as an
argument to a function, it is the pointer that is actually passed),
and <code>mpfr_ptr</code> is the C data type representing a pointer to this
structure.
</p>
<span id="index-Precision"></span>
<span id="index-mpfr_005fprec_005ft"></span>
<p>The <em>precision</em> is the number of bits used to represent the significand
of a floating-point number;
the corresponding C data type is <code>mpfr_prec_t</code>.
The precision can be any integer between <code>MPFR_PREC_MIN</code> and
<code>MPFR_PREC_MAX</code>. In the current implementation, <code>MPFR_PREC_MIN</code>
is equal to 1.
</p>
<p>Warning! MPFR needs to increase the precision internally, in order to
provide accurate results (and in particular, correct rounding). Do not
attempt to set the precision to any value near <code>MPFR_PREC_MAX</code>,
otherwise MPFR will abort due to an assertion failure. However, in practice,
the real limitation will probably be the available memory on your platform,
and in case of lack of memory, the program may abort, crash or have
undefined behavior (depending on your C implementation).
</p>
<span id="index-Exponent"></span>
<span id="index-mpfr_005fexp_005ft"></span>
<p>An <em>exponent</em> is a component of a regular floating-point number.
Its C data type is <code>mpfr_exp_t</code>. Valid exponents are restricted
to a subset of this type, and the exponent range can be changed globally
as described in <a href="Exception-Related-Functions.html">Exception Related Functions</a>. Special values do not
have an exponent.
</p>
<span id="index-Rounding"></span>
<span id="index-mpfr_005frnd_005ft"></span>
<p>The <em>rounding mode</em> specifies the way to round the result of a
floating-point operation, in case the exact result cannot be represented
exactly in the destination (see <a href="Rounding.html">Rounding</a>).
The corresponding C data type is <code>mpfr_rnd_t</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-Group-of-flags"></span>
<span id="index-mpfr_005fflags_005ft"></span>
<p>MPFR has a global (or per-thread) flag for each supported exception and
provides operations on flags (<a href="Exceptions.html">Exceptions</a>). This C data type is used
to represent a group of flags (or a mask).
